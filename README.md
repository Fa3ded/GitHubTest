# OneKey
## v2

This is a project that I am working on to not only get better at 3d design, Python, and C++, but it is also somthing I used to get better at GitHub. Feel free to leave a pull request if you have an improvment! Keep in mind that I am fairly new to programming and most of the code is either heavily influenced by Ai or is generated fully by Ai.

# Required Hardware:

* [Seeeduino Xiao](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html)
* Key Switch
* Any Keycap that fits
* Small thin wires

# Quick Rundown:
### YOU NEED SOME WAY TO RUN A PYTHON SCRIPT ON YOUR COMPUTER
I used the Visual Studio plugin for Python.
1. Upload the code to the Seeeduino and then sauter one of the switch pins to the digital input 2 and the other to ground.
2. Install the lib from the link below:
- [pyautogui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
4. Edit the python script's code to suit the port you are using and what apps you would like to open/what inputs you would like your OneKey to make.
